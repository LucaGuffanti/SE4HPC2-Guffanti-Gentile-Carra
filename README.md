# SE4HPCproject
The second section of the Software Engineering for HPC hands-on projects consists in the definition of a
continuous integration/deployment workflow to automate the build, test, and containerization steps.
Additionally, the introduction of the MPI-based matrix multiplication algorithm required the definition of a job script
to be run on the GALILEO Supercomputer as well as an extension of the previously defined action to target automatic 
execution on the cluster in the case of push to the repository.

## Results
In the root directory of the repository you will be able to find the [shell script](/job.sh) that was run on GALILEO. Workflows are defined 
in the usual directory [/.github/workflows](/.github/workflows), while the log files of the slurm job are present in the [/galileo](/galileo) directory, present
in the root. Finally, the Singularity container is present in the [/container](/container) directory.

## Workflows
We decided to implement two different workflows, in order to explore different approaches to the problem. Both the workflows are triggered by a push event on the main branch and run on the latest version of ubuntu. They build the project and the container in parallel, and then run the tests. Once the tests are completed, the container is deployed to the GALILEO supercomputer.

### Workflow A
The first workflow, [ci-pipeline-A.yml](/.github/workflows/ci-pipeline-A.yaml), is a faster version of the pipeline. It uses the cache action `actions/cache@v2` to speed up the build process and the `Singularity Remote` to upload the container to the GALILEO supercomputer.
The workflow is defined as follows:

### Workflow B
The second workflow, [ci-pipeline-B.yml](/.github/workflows/ci-pipeline-B.yaml), is a more structured version of the pipeline. It splits the build and test steps into two separate jobs, and uses `scp` to upload the container to the GALILEO supercomputer. The pipeline B replicates the structure of a real-world CI/CD pipeline, where the build and test steps are usually separated to allow for more flexibility and scalability. Each job produces an *artifact* that is passed to the next phase. Even though splitting the jobs increases the overall time of the pipeline, it allows for a more structured and modular approach to the problem, and makes it easier to debug and maintain the pipeline in the future. The workflow is defined as follows:

# SINGULARITY CONTAINER
The [/container](/container) contains two Singularity container definitions used to run the application. The first definition `matrix_multiplication.def` is built using the `ubuntu:22.04` base image, while the second definition `matrix_multiplication_lightweight.def` is built using the `debian:slim` base image. The two containers are built using the same commands, but the second one is lighter and faster to build.

To build the container, run the following command:

```bash
sudo singularity build mm.sif matrix_multiplication.def
``` 

The former command creates a compressed read-only Singularity Image File (SIF) named `mm.sif`. In order to build the container with writable root directory, you can specify the option `--sandbox` for interactive development. 

In order to create the container, two different approaches can be used:
- The container clones the repository and builds the application, installing all the dependencies. This approach allows to build the container independently from the host system, but it is slower and results in a larger container.
- The container uses a pre-built binary of the application, and only installs the necessary dependencies. This approach is faster and results in a smaller container, but it requires the application to be built on a compatible host system.

Both approaches are valid and since the application is small and has few dependencies, we decided to use the first approach. 

To run the container, use the following command:

```bash
singularity run mm.sif
```

To execute the tests, run the following command:

```bash
singularity test mm.sif
```
